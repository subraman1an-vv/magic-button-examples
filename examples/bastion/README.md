# Overview
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Bastion provides restricted and time-limited access to target resources that don't have public endpoints.

Bastions let authorized users connect from specific IP addresses to target resources using Secure Shell (SSH) sessions. When connected, users can interact with the target resource by using any software or protocol supported by SSH. For example, you can use the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to connect to a Windows host, or use Oracle Net Services to connect to a database.
