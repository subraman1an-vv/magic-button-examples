Anomaly Detection helps you to identify anomalies in a multivariate dataset by taking advantage of the interrelationship among signals.

Anomaly Detection automatically analyzes the dataset to build multivariate machine learning models for multivariate signals by considering their correlations among them. It also build univariate models for independent signals so that the final model can maximize the accuracy of identified anomalies. Anomaly Detection helps you monitor complex systems with large number of signals.
