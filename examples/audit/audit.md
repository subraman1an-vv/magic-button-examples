The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Audit service automatically records calls to all supported Oracle Cloud Infrastructure public application programming interface (API) endpoints as log events. Currently, all services support logging by Audit. Object Storage service supports logging for bucket-related events, but not for object-related events. Log events recorded by the Audit service include API calls made by the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console, Command Line Interface (CLI), Software Development Kits (SDK), your own custom clients, or other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. Information in the logs includes the following:  

- Time the API activity occurred
- Source of the activity
- Target of the activity
- Type of action
- Type of response  

Each log event includes a header ID, target resources, timestamp of the recorded event, request parameters, and response parameters. You can view events logged by the Audit service by using the Console, API, or the SDK for Java. Data from events can be used to perform diagnostics, track resource usage, monitor compliance, and collect security-related events.
